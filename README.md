# Not a Dog Workshop

This workshop is for beginners who would like to learn more about the cloud and the try some services available. Today artificial intelligence (AI) can benefit a lot of our application and most of the time it's easier then we think to implement it.

During this workshop you will deploy and complete a web application able to detect when picture are or not dogs and keep our images folder "clean". We call that application *The automatic Not a Dog application*.

> We are using dog as topics, but you can defenetly extend the capability of the application to manage picture of an event, the office, or a group. You could automatically generate tags and so many things...

## Part 1 - Deploy the solution to Azure

To get started we will deploy a simple Asp.Net Core MVC application to Azure. This website will display all the images contain in our Azure storage.

There is many different ways to deploy to Azure. You can deploy directly development tools like Visual Studio, build a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI-CD).  For today's workshop everything is prepared for you. Click the following link to get started.
